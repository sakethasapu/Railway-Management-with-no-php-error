Railway Management System (Without PHP Errors)

A Railway Management System is a web-based application designed to automate and manage railway operations such as train scheduling, ticket booking, passenger details, and payment processing. The system improves efficiency, reduces manual errors, and provides a smooth user experience for both passengers and administrators.

This project is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, along with a MySQL database. Special attention is given to proper coding practices to ensure the system runs without PHP errors, such as undefined variables, database connection failures, session issues, or form validation errors.
